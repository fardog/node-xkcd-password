# XKCD Password Generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fardog/node-xkcd-password.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/fardog/node-xkcd-password) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/fardog/node-xkcd-password.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/fardog/node-xkcd-password)

Creates an [XKCD-style password](http://xkcd.com/936/) based on your parameters.
Includes a CLI (`xkcd-password`) for your convenience, and a default wordlist.
Supports both a callback-based API and [Promises/A+](http://promisesaplus.com/).

> **Warning:** I am not a cryptographer, or any sort of password expert. An
> audit would be greatly appreciated.

## Installation

To install the module for use in your projects:

```
npm install xkcd-password
```

Or a global install to get the commandline client:

```
npm install xkcd-password -g
```

This will make the `xkcd-password` command available on your path.

## Usage

This can be used both as a module in another application, or when installed
globally, via a commandline application.

### CLI

```
$ xkcd-password --help

Usage: xkcd-password [options]

Options:
   -n, --numWords    The number of words to generate for your password.  [4]
   -m, --minLength   Minimum lengh of words chosen for the generated password.  [5]
   -x, --maxLength   Maximum length of words chosen for the generated password.  [8]
   -f, --wordFile    The newline-delimited list of words to be used as the source.
   -s, --separator   The separator character to use between words when output to the console.  [ ]
   --version         print version and exit
```

### Module

```js
var xkcdPassword = require('xkcd-password')
var pw = new xkcdPassword()

var options = {
  numWords: 4,
  minLength: 5,
  maxLength: 8
}

// using callbacks
pw.generate(options, function (err, result) {
  console.log(result)  // ['distome', 'pantries', 'sending', 'weiner']
})


// or, with promises
pw.generate(options).then(function (result) {
  console.log(result) // [ 'crambo', 'piled', 'procural', 'plunk' ]
}).catch(function(err) {
  if (!err) {
    console.log('No errors here!')
  }
})
```

## Environment Variables

- **DISABLE_LOOP_PREVENTION**  
It's possible for you to ask for a very specific list of words—say, 100 two
character passwords—which would fail if you didn't have enough words of that
size, but your wordlist was big enough—say 1000 words. As such, loop prevention
was added in v1.1.0. If you'd like to disable this prevention, set
`DISABLE_LOOP_PREVENTION` to a truth-y value.

## Notes

- The CLI will set the minimum word length to 1 if the maximum word length
  requested is below the default minimum word length (5), and the minimum is not
  set. This is as of version 1.2.0. This is to simplify asking for very small
  words from the CLI. This does not apply to using the module in your
  applications, just the CLI.

## Known Bugs

- Trying to generate more a large number of words in a single `generate()` call
  may overflow the call stack. You'll usually be fine up to 2500 words though so
  it's not much of a problem.

## Contributing

Feel free to send pull requests! I'm not picky, but would like the following:

1. Write tests for any new features, and do not break existing tests.
2. Be sure to point out any changes that break API.

## History

- **v2.0.0**  
Update all dependencies and require Node.js 4 and above. — _[@cabbiepete][]_  
Updates to [standard](http://standardjs.com) style. — _[@fardog][]_  
Move tests to [tape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape). — _[@fardog][]_  
Allow use without the `new` keyword. — _[@fardog][]_

- **v1.2.0**  
Replaces [nomnom][nomnom] with [minimist][minimist], and adds a custom validator
for CLI options.

- **v1.1.1**  
Updates dependencies and internal documentation. Adds dependency badge.

- **v1.1.0**  
Doesn't use promises unless you haven't specified a callback. Prevents the
generator from entering an infinite loop. Adds additional checks on minimum and
maximum word length options.

- **v1.0.0**  
API now supports Promises as well as callbacks.

- **v0.2.7**  
Updates to the latest version of [random-lib][randomlib] and debug.

- **v0.2.6**  
Updates to the latest version of [async][async], so that xkcd-password
and [random-lib][randomlib] use the same version.

- **v0.2.5**  
Additional tests.

- **v0.2.4**  
Avoids [releasing Zalgo][zalgo] on errors.

- **v0.2.3**  
Smarter rewrite of word generation function based on additional functionality
that [random-lib][randomlib] provides. Additional tests.

- **v0.2.2**  
Now uses my [random-lib][randomlib] wrapper for `crypto.randomBytes()`.

- **v0.2.1**  
Now uses Node's `crypto.randomBytes()` for its PRNG, rather than Math.random()
in most cases.

- **v0.2.0**  
Changes generation function to accept an "options" object rather than discrete
parameters to the generate function. Provides defaults if options aren't given.
